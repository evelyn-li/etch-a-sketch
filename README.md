# Etch-a-Sketch
A project in which I built a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. It's basically a web toy that can be used to draw and make pixel art. The main goal of this project is to practice advanced DOM manipulation.

Note: No mobile support at this time. In addition, I plan to come back later and apply more styling to the UI.

From [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project) curriculum.

## How to Use
Click and hold anywhere inside the grid to start drawing. As long as the mouse button is down, the pen will color the squares as it follows your cursor. The default pen and grid settings can be changed using the controls on the left.

## Features
- Draw with custom pen color
- Draw with random pen color (randomly generated color for each square)
- Choose background color
- Erase
- Clear grid
- Turn grid lines on/off
- Change grid dimensions (2x2 up to 64x64)

## Skills Learned
- Creating and inserting elements using the DOM (instead of manually through HTML)
- Making a bunch of divs appear as a grid
- Connecting HTML inputs and data to my JavaScript code
- Using a combination of DOM events and the event object to create a click-and-hold effect
- Allowing only one feature/mode to be selected at a time

## Languages / Technologies
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- VS Code
- Linux terminal
- Git and Github
